# Mini Operating System Simulator 🖥️

A terminal-based Operating System Simulation developed in **C** as part of the Operating Systems Lab 🧪 at **FAST National University**. This project was done under the supervision of **Mr. Hassan Ahmed** in collaboration with **Amama Sajjad**.

---

## Features ⚙️

- Dual operational modes: **User Mode** and **Kernel Mode**
- Over **15 utilities**, including:
  - Media playback (audio/video) 🎵🎬
  - File and directory management 📁📄
  - Terminal-based notepad using `nano` 📝
  - Basic calculator, BMI calculator, temperature converter ➗🌡️
  - System information viewer 🖥️
  - Multiplayer number guessing game 🎮

---

## Technical Implementation 🔧

- Developed in C using standard libraries and Unix system calls
- Process spawning with `fork()` and `exec()`
- File and directory operations using Unix utilities (`mkdir`, `nano`, etc.)
- Modular code structure: each utility/function implemented in separate source files
- Menu-driven interface with role-based access control (user/kernel)
- Terminal-based UI with input validation and error handling

---

## Learning Outcomes 📚

- Practical experience with multitasking and process management
- Understanding of user and kernel mode separation in OS
- Familiarity with Linux system programming and shell command integration
- Designing modular C programs with clear interfaces
- Hands-on with terminal UI design and command execution
