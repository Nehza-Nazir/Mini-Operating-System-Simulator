# Mini-Operating-System-Simulator
Mini OS Simulator in C simulating multitasking with user/kernel modes. Features 15+ utilities like media player, file manager, calculator, notepad, system info, and games. Uses fork(), exec(), Unix tools. Modular design with clean structure. Developed for FAST OS Lab under Mr. Hassan Ahmed with Amama Sajjad.
## Features ⚙️

- Dual operational modes: **User Mode** and **Kernel Mode**
- Over **15 utilities**, including:
  - Media playback (audio/video) 🎵🎬
  - File and directory management 📁📄
  - Terminal-based notepad using `nano` 📝
  - Basic calculator, BMI calculator, temperature converter ➗🌡️
  - System information viewer 🖥️
  - Multiplayer number guessing game 🎮

---

## Technical Implementation 🔧

- Developed in C using standard libraries and Unix system calls
- Process spawning with `fork()` and `exec()`
- File and directory operations using Unix utilities (`mkdir`, `nano`, etc.)
- Modular code structure: each utility/function implemented in separate source files
- Menu-driven interface with role-based access control (user/kernel)
- Terminal-based UI with input validation and error handling

---

## Learning Outcomes 📚

- Practical experience with multitasking and process management
- Understanding of user and kernel mode separation in OS
- Familiarity with Linux system programming and shell command integration
- Designing modular C programs with clear interfaces
- Hands-on with terminal UI design and command execution
